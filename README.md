I learned a lot about responsive design and accessibility. Using Tailwind CSS was a game-changer, as it helped me streamline the styling process and keep my code organized. I also learned the importance of user feedback and how it can greatly impact the design and functionality of a website. Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me.
